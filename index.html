<h2>Francis Wooff</h2>
<header>
<p>Web tinkerer/journeyman. Web technology is something I've become interested &amp; mildly proficient in late in life. My aesthetic design skills are rudimentary, but I enjoy learning the technologies. To mitigate shortcomings on the design side I usually build very simple &amp; clean sites. If they're not the most refined on the eye, they are compliant with latest standards (&amp; hopefully good practice), accessible &amp; lightweight.</p>
<p>I'm also a musician &amp; DJ &amp; promoter at <a href="http://www.thatamazingthing.com" target="_blank">That Amazing Thing!</a> the well-loved, but occasional, Manchester night.</p>
<p>... &amp; a modest-paced, but enthusiastic fell-runner (if you need a quick &amp; simple web page or site which benefits the fell-running community ask if I have availability to help, I like to support those who support me).</p>
<p><b>This is a holding page</b>, I plan to update it with details of projects I'm working on. For now, hello!</p>

<a href="https://github.com/FrancisWooff" target="_blank"><h3>My GitHub projects</h3></a>
<p>Want somewhere to store your code, version as you develop &amp; make it accessible to others? Many use GitHub. It has more advantages than those just listed. Only thing is you then have to "Learn Git" just as you're busy learning new code &#128580;</p>
<p>Never mind, I've started: <a href="https://github.com/FrancisWooff" target="_blank">here I am</a></p>
